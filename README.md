# saturation
Display player saturation in vanilla Minecraft 1.13

This small datapack will allow a player to see their food saturation as a bossbar display. You simply hold an item with the NBT data {saturation:1b} to make the bossbar visible. To acquire an item for testing, you could use something like:

/give @p minecraft:stick{saturation:1b}

Enjoy!
